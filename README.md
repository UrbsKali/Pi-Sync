# Pi Sync
Repository for my Syncronisation program written in python

# How to Use for you ?
I made this program for my computer, but with some minor change, you will be able to use it !

### 1 - set your folder to save inside the folder_to_save list (lign 5)
### 2 - change the location of the sync with your NAS location (lign 37, 39, 42)
### 3 - change the icon path with the **absolute** path to the icon (lign 45, 47)
### 4 - Run the command ```python3 setup.py build``` with cx_Freeze install on your computer (see Requirement)
